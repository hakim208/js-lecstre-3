## What is a block scope?
### Block scope is often used in conditional statements and loops to control the scope of variables. 

## What is hosting in js?
### In JavaScript, hoisting refers to the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope â€“ all before code execution. In turn, this allows us to use functions, variables, and classes before they are declared.
